# Pastebot

Pastebot is a bot for Slack, written in Ruby, mostly as a side project while working through my first semester of university. When completed, the bot is intended for use by the Unity Security Force, a group of Arma 3 players.

Instructions for getting pastebot up and running on your own server, as well as customising it will be available once the project is complete.
